title: 899. Binary Gap
---
### Question
Given a positive integer `N`, find and return the longest distance between two
consecutive 1's in the binary representation of `N`.

If there aren't two consecutive 1's, return 0.



 **Example 1:**

    
    
     **Input:** 22
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:**
    22 in binary is 0b10110.
    In the binary representation of 22, there are three ones, and two consecutive pairs of 1's.
    The first consecutive pair of 1's have distance 2.
    The second consecutive pair of 1's have distance 1.
    The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** 5
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:**
    5 in binary is 0b101.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** 6
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:**
    6 in binary is 0b110.
    

**Example 4:**

    
    
    **Input:** 8
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:**
    8 in binary is 0b1000.
    There aren't any consecutive pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.
    



 **Note:**

  * `1 <= N <= 10^9`

### Solution 1
One pass on `N` in binary from right to left.  
`d` means the distance from the last 1 position.  
`d` is initial to a small enough value `-32`

 **C++:**

    
    
         int binaryGap(int N) {
            int res = 0;
            for (int d = -32; N; N /= 2, d++)
                if (N % 2) res = max(res, d), d = 0;
            return res;
        }
    

**Java:**

    
    
         public int binaryGap(int N) {
            int res = 0;
            for (int d = -32; N > 0; N /= 2, d++)
                if (N % 2 == 1) {
                    res = Math.max(res, d);
                    d = 0;
                }
            return res;
        }
    

**Python:**

    
    
         def binaryGap(self, N):
            index = [i for i, v in enumerate(bin(N)) if v == '1']
            return max([b - a for a, b in zip(index, index[1:])] or [0])
    


### Solution 2
From where to where?  
Or from which index to which index?


### Solution 3
    
    
    class Solution {
        public int binaryGap(int N) {
            int max = 0;
            int pos = 0;
            int lastPos = -1;
            while (N != 0) {
                pos++;
                if ((N & 1) == 1) {
                    if (lastPos != -1) {
                        max = Math.max(max, pos-lastPos);
                    }
                    lastPos = pos;
                }
                N >>= 1;
            }
            return max;
        }
    }
