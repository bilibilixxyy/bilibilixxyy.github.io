title: 191. Number of 1 Bits
---
### Question
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1'
bits it has (also known as the [Hamming
weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).



 **Example 1:**

    
    
     **Input:** 00000000000000000000000000001011
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The input binary string **00000000000000000000000000001011**  has a total of three '1' bits.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** 00000000000000000000000010000000
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** The input binary string **00000000000000000000000010000000**  has a total of one '1' bit.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** 11111111111111111111111111111101
    **Output:** 31
    **Explanation:** The input binary string **11111111111111111111111111111101** has a total of thirty one '1' bits.



 **Note:**

  * Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as signed integer type and should not affect your implementation, as the internal binary representation of the integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.
  * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**  above the input represents the signed integer `-3`.

If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

### Solution 1
    
    
    public static int hammingWeight(int n) {
    	int ones = 0;
        	while(n!=0) {
        		ones = ones + (n & 1);
        		n = n>>>1;
        	}
        	return ones;
    }
    

  * An Integer in Java has 32 bits, e.g. 00101000011110010100001000011010.
  * To count the 1s in the Integer representation we put the input int  
n in bit AND with 1 (that is represented as  
00000000000000000000000000000001, and if this operation result is 1,  
that means that the last bit of the input integer is 1. Thus we add it to the
1s count.

> ones = ones + (n & 1);

  * Then we shift the input Integer by one on the right, to check for the  
next bit.

> n = n>>>1;

We need to use bit shifting unsigned operation **> >>** (while **> >** depends
on sign extension)

  * We keep doing this until the input Integer is 0.

In Java we need to put attention on the fact that the maximum integer is
2147483647. Integer type in Java is signed and there is no unsigned int. So
the input 2147483648 is represented in Java as -2147483648 (in java int type
has a cyclic representation, that means
**Integer.MAX_VALUE+1==Integer.MIN_VALUE** ).  
This force us to use

> n!=0

in the while condition and we cannot use

> n>0

because the input 2147483648 would correspond to -2147483648 in java and the
code would not enter the while if the condition is n>0 for n=2147483648.


### Solution 2
Each time of "n &= n - 1", we delete one '1' from n.

    
    
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n)
    {
        int res = 0;
        while(n)
        {
            n &= n - 1;
            ++ res;
        }
        return res;
    }

Add 1 by Tree:

    
    
    // This is a naive implementation, shown for comparison, and to help in understanding the better functions. 
    // It uses 24 arithmetic operations (shift, add, and).
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n)
    {
        n = (n & 0x55555555) + (n >>  1 & 0x55555555); // put count of each  2 bits into those  2 bits 
        n = (n & 0x33333333) + (n >>  2 & 0x33333333); // put count of each  4 bits into those  4 bits 
        n = (n & 0x0F0F0F0F) + (n >>  4 & 0x0F0F0F0F); // put count of each  8 bits into those  8 bits 
        n = (n & 0x00FF00FF) + (n >>  8 & 0x00FF00FF); // put count of each 16 bits into those 16 bits 
        n = (n & 0x0000FFFF) + (n >> 16 & 0x0000FFFF); // put count of each 32 bits into those 32 bits 
        return n;
    }
    
    // This uses fewer arithmetic operations than any other known implementation on machines with slow multiplication.
    // It uses 17 arithmetic operations.
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n)
    {
        n -= (n >> 1) & 0x55555555; //put count of each 2 bits into those 2 bits
        n = (n & 0x33333333) + (n >> 2 & 0x33333333); //put count of each 4 bits into those 4 bits
        n = (n + (n >> 4)) & 0x0F0F0F0F; //put count of each 8 bits into those 8 bits
        n += n >> 8; // put count of each 16 bits into those 8 bits
        n += n >> 16; // put count of each 32 bits into those 8 bits
        return n & 0xFF;
    }
    
    // This uses fewer arithmetic operations than any other known implementation on machines with fast multiplication.
    // It uses 12 arithmetic operations, one of which is a multiply.
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n)
    {
        n -= (n >> 1) & 0x55555555; // put count of each 2 bits into those 2 bits
        n = (n & 0x33333333) + (n >> 2 & 0x33333333); // put count of each 4 bits into those 4 bits
        n = (n + (n >> 4)) & 0x0F0F0F0F; // put count of each 8 bits into those 8 bits 
        return n * 0x01010101 >> 24; // returns left 8 bits of x + (x<<8) + (x<<16) + (x<<24)
    }

### Solution 3
    
    
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        while (n) {
            n &= (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    

n & (n - 1) drops the lowest set bit. It's a neat little bit trick.

Let's use n = 00101100 as an example. This binary representation has three 1s.

If n = 00101100, then n - 1 = 00101011, so n & (n - 1) = 00101100 & 00101011 =
00101000. Count = 1.

If n = 00101000, then n - 1 = 00100111, so n & (n - 1) = 00101000 & 00100111 =
00100000. Count = 2.

If n = 00100000, then n - 1 = 00011111, so n & (n - 1) = 00100000 & 00011111 =
00000000. Count = 3.

n is now zero, so the while loop ends, and the final count (the numbers of set
bits) is returned.
