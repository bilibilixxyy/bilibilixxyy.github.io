title: 342. Power of Four
---
### Question
Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a
power of 4.

 **Example 1:**

    
    
     **Input:** 16
    **Output:** true
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** 5
    **Output:** false

 **Follow up** : Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

### Solution 1
    
    
         public boolean isPowerOfFour(int num) {
            return num > 0 && (num&(num-1)) == 0 && (num & 0x55555555) != 0;
            //0x55555555 is to get rid of those power of 2 but not power of 4
            //so that the single 1 bit always appears at the odd position 
        }


### Solution 2
    
    
    bool isPowerOfFour(int num) {
        return num > 0 && (num & (num - 1)) == 0 && (num - 1) % 3 == 0;
    }


### Solution 3
    
    
    public class Solution {
        public boolean isPowerOfFour(int num) {
            return (num > 0) && ((num & (num - 1)) == 0) && ((num & 0x55555555) == num);
        }
    }
    

The basic idea is from power of 2, We can use "n&(n-1) == 0" to determine if n
is power of 2. For power of 4, the additional restriction is that in binary
form, the only "1" should always located at the odd position. For example, 4^0
= 1, 4^1 = 100, 4^2 = 10000. So we can use "num & 0x55555555==num" to check if
"1" is located at the odd position.
