title: 90. Subsets II

### Question
Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, **_nums_** ,
return all possible subsets (the power set).

 **Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

 **Example:**

    
    
     **Input:** [1,2,2]
    **Output:**
    [
      [2],
      [1],
      [1,2,2],
      [2,2],
      [1,2],
      []
    ]
    

### Solution 1
To solve this problem, it is helpful to first think how many subsets are
there. If there is no duplicate element, the answer is simply 2^n, where n is
the number of elements. This is because you have two choices for each element,
either putting it into the subset or not. So all subsets for this no-duplicate
set can be easily constructed:  
num of subset

  * (1 to 2^0) empty set is the first subset
  * (2^0+1 to 2^1) add the first element into subset from (1)
  * (2^1+1 to 2^2) add the second element into subset (1 to 2^1)
  * (2^2+1 to 2^3) add the third element into subset (1 to 2^2)
  * ....
  * (2^(n-1)+1 to 2^n) add the nth element into subset(1 to 2^(n-1))

Then how many subsets are there if there are duplicate elements? We can treat
duplicate element as a spacial element. For example, if we have duplicate
elements (5, 5), instead of treating them as two elements that are duplicate,
we can treat it as one special element 5, but this element has more than two
choices: you can either NOT put it into the subset, or put ONE 5 into the
subset, or put TWO 5s into the subset. Therefore, we are given an array (a1,
a2, a3, ..., an) with each of them appearing (k1, k2, k3, ..., kn) times, the
number of subset is (k1+1) _(k2+1)_...(kn+1). We can easily see how to write
down all the subsets similar to the approach above.

    
    
         class Solution {
    public:
        vector<vector<int> > subsetsWithDup(vector<int> &S) {
            vector<vector<int> > totalset = {{}};
            sort(S.begin(),S.end());
            for(int i=0; i<S.size();){
                int count = 0; // num of elements are the same
                while(count + i<S.size() && S[count+i]==S[i])  count++;
                int previousN = totalset.size();
                for(int k=0; k<previousN; k++){
                    vector<int> instance = totalset[k];
                    for(int j=0; j<count; j++){
                        instance.push_back(S[i]);
                        totalset.push_back(instance);
                    }
                }
                i += count;
            }
            return totalset;
            }
    };


### Solution 2
If we want to insert an element which is a dup, we can only insert it after
the newly inserted elements from last step.

    
    
    vector<vector<int> > subsetsWithDup(vector<int> &S) {
        sort(S.begin(), S.end());
        vector<vector<int>> ret = {{}};
        int size = 0, startIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++) {
            startIndex = i >= 1 && S[i] == S[i - 1] ? size : 0;
            size = ret.size();
            for (int j = startIndex; j < size; j++) {
                vector<int> temp = ret[j];
                temp.push_back(S[i]);
                ret.push_back(temp);
            }
        }
        return ret;
    }


### Solution 3
    
    
    class Solution:
        # @param num, a list of integer
        # @return a list of lists of integer
        def subsetsWithDup(self, S):
            res = [[]]
            S.sort()
            for i in range(len(S)):
                if i == 0 or S[i] != S[i - 1]:
                    l = len(res)
                for j in range(len(res) - l, len(res)):
                    res.append(res[j] + [S[i]])
            return res
    

if S[i] is same to S[i - 1], then it needn't to be added to all of the subset,
just add it to the last l subsets which are created by adding S[i - 1]
