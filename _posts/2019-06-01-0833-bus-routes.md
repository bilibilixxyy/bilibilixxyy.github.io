title: 833. Bus Routes
---
### Question
We have a list of bus routes. Each `routes[i]` is a bus route that the i-th
bus repeats forever. For example if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that
the first bus (0-th indexed) travels in the sequence 1->5->7->1->5->7->1->...
forever.

We start at bus stop `S` (initially not on a bus), and we want to go to bus
stop `T`. Travelling by buses only, what is the least number of buses we must
take to reach our destination? Return -1 if it is not possible.

    
    
     **Example:**
    **Input:** 
    routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]]
    S = 1
    T = 6
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** 
    The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
    

**Note:**

  * `1 <= routes.length <= 500`.
  * `1 <= routes[i].length <= 500`.
  * `0 <= routes[i][j] < 10 ^ 6`.

### Solution 1
For each of the bus stop, we maintain all the buses (bus routes) that go
through it. To do that, we use a HashMap, where bus stop number is the key and
all the buses (bus routes) that go through it are added to an ArrayList.

We use BFS, where we process elements in a level-wise manner. We add the Start
bus stop in the queue. Next, when we enter the while loop, we add all the bus
stops that are reachable by all the bus routes that go via the Start. Thus, if
we have the input as [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]] and Start as 6, then upon
processing bus stop 6, we would add bus stops 3 and 7.  
With this approach, all the bus stops at a given level, are "equal distance"
from the start node, in terms of number of buses that need to be changed.

To avoid loops, we also maintain a HashSet that stores the buses that we have
already visited.

Note that while in this approach, we use each stop for doing BFS, one could
also consider each bus (route) also for BFS.

    
    
    class Solution {
        public int numBusesToDestination(int[][] routes, int S, int T) {
           HashSet<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
           Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
           HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();
           int ret = 0; 
            
           if (S==T) return 0; 
            
           for(int i = 0; i < routes.length; i++){
                for(int j = 0; j < routes[i].length; j++){
                    ArrayList<Integer> buses = map.getOrDefault(routes[i][j], new ArrayList<>());
                    buses.add(i);
                    map.put(routes[i][j], buses);                
                }       
            }
                    
           q.offer(S); 
           while (!q.isEmpty()) {
               int len = q.size();
               ret++;
               for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                   int cur = q.poll();
                   ArrayList<Integer> buses = map.get(cur);
                   for (int bus: buses) {
                        if (visited.contains(bus)) continue;
                        visited.add(bus);
                        for (int j = 0; j < routes[bus].length; j++) {
                            if (routes[bus][j] == T) return ret;
                            q.offer(routes[bus][j]);  
                       }
                   }
               }
            }
            return -1;
        }
    }
    


### Solution 2
The first part loop on routes and record stop to routes mapping in `to_route`.  
The second part is general bfs. Take a stop from queue and find all connected
route.  
The set `seen` record all stops visted and we won't check a stop for twice.  
We can also use a set to record all routes visted , or just clear a route
after visit.

 **C++:**

    
    
         int numBusesToDestination(vector<vector<int>>& routes, int S, int T) {
            unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> to_route;
            for (int i = 0; i < routes.size(); ++i) for (auto& j : routes[i]) to_route[j].insert(i);
            queue<pair<int, int>> bfs; bfs.push(make_pair(S, 0));
            unordered_set<int> seen = {S};
            while (!bfs.empty()) {
                int stop = bfs.front().first, bus = bfs.front().second;
                bfs.pop();
                if (stop == T) return bus;
                for (auto& route_i : to_route[stop]) {
                    for (auto& next_stop : routes[route_i])
                        if (seen.find(next_stop) == seen.end()) {
                            seen.insert(next_stop);
                            bfs.push(make_pair(next_stop, bus + 1));
                        }
                    routes[route_i].clear();
                }
            }
            return -1;
        }
    

**Java:**

    
    
         public int numBusesToDestination(int[][] routes, int S, int T) {
            HashMap<Integer, HashSet<Integer>> to_routes = new HashMap<>();
            for (int i = 0; i < routes.length; ++i)
                for (int j : routes[i]) {
                    if (!to_routes.containsKey(j)) to_routes.put(j, new HashSet<Integer>());
                    to_routes.get(j).add(i);
                }
            Queue<Point> bfs = new ArrayDeque();
            bfs.offer(new Point(S, 0));
            HashSet<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
            seen.add(S);
            while (!bfs.isEmpty()) {
                int stop = bfs.peek().x, bus = bfs.peek().y;
                bfs.poll();
                if (stop == T) return bus;
                for (int route_i : to_routes.get(stop))
                    for (int next_stop : routes[route_i])
                        if (!seen.contains(next_stop)) {
                            seen.add(next_stop);
                            bfs.offer(new Point(next_stop, bus + 1));
                        }
            }
            return -1;
        }
    

**Python:**

    
    
        def numBusesToDestination(self, routes, S, T):
            to_routes = collections.defaultdict( set)
            for i,route in enumerate(routes):
                for j in route: to_routes[j].add(i)
            bfs = [(S,0)]
            seen = set([S])
            for stop, bus in bfs:
                if stop == T: return bus
                for route_i in to_routes[stop]:
                    for next_stop in routes[route_i]:
                        if next_stop not in seen:
                            bfs.append((next_stop, bus+1))
                            seen.add(next_stop)
                    routes[route_i] = []
            return -1
    


### Solution 3
It says that 1 <= routes[i].length <= 500, why there is test case where
routes[i].length is 89700??
