### Question
Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only
once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements
that appear only once.

 **Example:**

    
    
     **Input:**  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
    **Output:** [3,5]

 **Note** :

  1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
  2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

### Solution 1
Once again, we need to use XOR to solve this problem. But this time, we need
to do it in two passes:

  * In the first pass, we XOR all elements in the array, and get the XOR of the two numbers we need to find. Note that since the two numbers are distinct, so there must be a set bit (that is, the bit with value '1') in the XOR result. Find  
out an arbitrary set bit (for example, the rightmost set bit).

  * In the second pass, we divide all numbers into two groups, one with the aforementioned bit set, another with the aforementinoed bit unset. Two different numbers we need to find must fall into thte two distrinct groups. XOR numbers in each group, we can find a number in either group.

 **Complexity:**

  * Time: _O_ ( _n_ )

  * Space: _O_ (1)

 **A Corner Case:**

  * When `diff == numeric_limits<int>::min()`, `-diff` is also `numeric_limits<int>::min()`. Therefore, the value of `diff` after executing `diff &= -diff` is still `numeric_limits<int>::min()`. The answer is still correct.

C++:

    
    
    class Solution
    {
    public:
        vector<int> singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) 
        {
            // Pass 1 : 
            // Get the XOR of the two numbers we need to find
            int diff = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0, bit_xor<int>());
            // Get its last set bit
            diff &= -diff;
    
            // Pass 2 :
            vector<int> rets = {0, 0}; // this vector stores the two numbers we will return
            for (int num : nums)
            {
                if ((num & diff) == 0) // the bit is not set
                {
                    rets[0] ^= num;
                }
                else // the bit is set
                {
                    rets[1] ^= num;
                }
            }
            return rets;
        }
    };
    

Java:

    
    
    public class Solution {
        public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
            // Pass 1 : 
            // Get the XOR of the two numbers we need to find
            int diff = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                diff ^= num;
            }
            // Get its last set bit
            diff &= -diff;
            
            // Pass 2 :
            int[] rets = {0, 0}; // this array stores the two numbers we will return
            for (int num : nums)
            {
                if ((num & diff) == 0) // the bit is not set
                {
                    rets[0] ^= num;
                }
                else // the bit is set
                {
                    rets[1] ^= num;
                }
            }
            return rets;
        }
    }

  * Thank **@jianchao.li.fighter** for introducing this problem and for your encouragement.

  * Thank **@StefanPochmann** for your valuable suggestions and comments. Your idea of `diff &= -diff` is very elegent! And yes, it does not need to XOR for both group in the second pass. XOR for one group suffices. I revise my code accordingly.

  * Thank **@Nakagawa_Kanon** for posting this question and presenting the same idea in a previous thread (prior to this thread).

  * Thank **@caijun** for providing an interesting test case.


### Solution 2
If you were stuck by this problem, it's easy to find a solution in the
discussion. However, usually, the solution lacks some explanations.

I'm sharing my understanding here:

The two numbers that appear only once must differ at some bit, this is how we
can distinguish between them. Otherwise, they will be one of the duplicate
numbers.

One important point is that by XORing all the numbers, we actually get the XOR
of the two target numbers (because XORing two duplicate numbers always results
in 0). Consider the XOR result of the two target numbers; if some bit of the
XOR result is 1, it means that the two target numbers differ at that location.

Letâ€™s say the at the ith bit, the two desired numbers differ from each other.
which means one number has bit i equaling: 0, the other number has bit i
equaling 1.

Thus, all the numbers can be partitioned into two groups according to their
bits at location i.  
the first group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 0.  
the second group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 1.

Notice that, if a duplicate number has bit i as 0, then, two copies of it will
belong to the first group. Similarly, if a duplicate number has bit i as 1,
then, two copies of it will belong to the second group.

by XoRing all numbers in the first group, we can get the first number.  
by XoRing all numbers in the second group, we can get the second number.


### Solution 3
    
    
    vector<int> singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int aXorb = 0;  // the result of a xor b;
        for (auto item : nums) aXorb ^= item;
        int lastBit = (aXorb & (aXorb - 1)) ^ aXorb;  // the last bit that a diffs b
        int intA = 0, intB = 0;
        for (auto item : nums) {
            // based on the last bit, group the items into groupA(include a) and groupB
            if (item & lastBit) intA = intA ^ item;
            else intB = intB ^ item;
        }
        return vector<int>{intA, intB};   
    }
