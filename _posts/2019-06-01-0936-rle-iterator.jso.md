title: 936. RLE Iterator
---
### Question
Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by `RLEIterator(int[] A)`, where `A` is a run-
length encoding of some sequence.  More specifically, for all even `i`, `A[i]`
tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value `A[i+1]` is
repeated in the sequence.

The iterator supports one function: `next(int n)`, which exhausts the next `n`
elements (`n >= 1`) and returns the last element exhausted in this way.  If
there is no element left to exhaust, `next` returns `-1` instead.

For example, we start with `A = [3,8,0,9,2,5]`, which is a run-length encoding
of the sequence `[8,8,8,5,5]`.  This is because the sequence can be read as
"three eights, zero nines, two fives".



 **Example 1:**

    
    
     **Input:** ["RLEIterator","next","next","next","next"], [[[3,8,0,9,2,5]],[2],[1],[1],[2]]
    **Output:** [null,8,8,5,-1]
    **Explanation:**
    RLEIterator is initialized with RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]).
    This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].
    RLEIterator.next is then called 4 times:
    
    .next(2) exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].
    
    .next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].
    
    .next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5.  The remaining sequence is now [5].
    
    .next(2) exhausts 2 terms, returning -1.  This is because the first term exhausted was 5,
    but the second term did not exist.  Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.
    
    

**Note:**

  1. `0 <= A.length <= 1000`
  2. `A.length` is an even integer.
  3. `0 <= A[i] <= 10^9`
  4. There are at most `1000` calls to `RLEIterator.next(int n)` per test case.
  5. Each call to `RLEIterator.next(int n)` will have `1 <= n <= 10^9`.

### Solution 1
    
    
    class RLEIterator {
        int index;
        int [] A;
        public RLEIterator(int[] A) {
            this.A = A;
            index = 0;
        }
        
        public int next(int n) {
            while(index < A.length && n > A[index]){
                n = n - A[index];
                index += 2;
            }
            
            if(index >= A.length){
                return -1;
            }
            
            A[index] = A[index] - n;
            return A[index + 1];
        }
    }
    

Note: input array doesn't count as extra space. I would say this problem is a
O(n) space problem, but the solution I use is only O(1) space, since I didn't
allocate any extra space.


### Solution 2
    
    
        private int idx = 0;
        private int[] A;
    		
        public RLEIterator(int[] A) { this.A = A; } // Injected A[]
        
        public int next(int n) {
            while (idx < A.length && n > A[idx]) { // exhaust as many terms as possible.
                n -= A[idx]; // exhaust A[idx + 1] for A[idx] times. 
                idx += 2; // move to next term.
            }
            if (idx < A.length) { // not exhaust all terms.
                A[idx] -= n;
                return A[idx + 1];
            }
            return -1; // exhaust all terms but still not enough.
        }
    


### Solution 3
    
    
    class RLEIterator:
    
        def __init__(self, A):
            """
            :type A: List[int]
            """
            global a
            a = []
            for x in range(int(len(A)/2)):
                if A[2*x] != 0:
                    a.insert(0, [A[2*x],A[2*x+1]])
    
        def next(self, n):
            """
            :type n: int
            :rtype: int
            """
            global a
            while n > 0:
                if a:
                    i = a.pop()
                    if i[0] >= n:
                        i[0] -= n
                        if i[0] != 0:
                            a.append(i)
                        return i[1]
                    else:
                        n-= i[0] 
                else:
                    return -1
    

Could probably make it much cleaner, but I don't really know what I did. Let
me know if you guys figure it out.
