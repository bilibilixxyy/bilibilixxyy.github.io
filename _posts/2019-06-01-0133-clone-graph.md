title: 133. Clone Graph
---
### Question
Given a reference of a node in a
**[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_\(graph_theory\)#Connected_graph)**
undirected graph, return a [**deep
copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the
graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`)
of its neighbors.



 **Example:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/19/113_sample.png)

    
    
     **Input:** {"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}
    
    **Explanation:**
    Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
    Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
    Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
    Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
    



 **Note:**

  1. The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
  2. The undirected graph is a [simple graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_\(discrete_mathematics\)#Simple_graph), which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
  3. Since the graph is undirected, if node _p_  has node _q_  as neighbor, then node _q_  must have node _p_  as neighbor too.
  4. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

### Solution 1
    
    
    public class Solution {
        private HashMap<Integer, UndirectedGraphNode> map = new HashMap<>();
        public UndirectedGraphNode cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode node) {
            return clone(node);
        }
    
        private UndirectedGraphNode clone(UndirectedGraphNode node) {
            if (node == null) return null;
            
            if (map.containsKey(node.label)) {
                return map.get(node.label);
            }
            UndirectedGraphNode clone = new UndirectedGraphNode(node.label);
            map.put(clone.label, clone);
            for (UndirectedGraphNode neighbor : node.neighbors) {
                clone.neighbors.add(clone(neighbor));
            }
            return clone;
        }
    }


### Solution 2
To clone a graph, you will need to traverse it. Both BFS and DFS are for this
purpose. But that is not all you need. To clone a graph, you need to have a
copy of each node and you need to **avoid copying the same node for multiple
times**. So you still need a mapping from an original node to its copy.

 **BFS**

    
    
     class Solution {
    public:
        Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
            if (!node) {
                return NULL;
            }
            Node* copy = new Node(node -> val, {});
            copies[node] = copy;
            queue<Node*> todo;
            todo.push(node);
            while (!todo.empty()) {
                Node* cur = todo.front();
                todo.pop();
                for (Node* neighbor : cur -> neighbors) {
                    if (copies.find(neighbor) == copies.end()) {
                        copies[neighbor] = new Node(neighbor -> val, {});
                        todo.push(neighbor);
                    }
                    copies[cur] -> neighbors.push_back(copies[neighbor]);
                }
            }
            return copy;
        }
    private:
        unordered_map<Node*, Node*> copies;
    };
    

**DFS**

The following succinct DFS code is taken from [this
post](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-
graph/discuss/42362/9-line-c%2B%2B-DFS-Solution).

    
    
    class Solution {
    public:
        Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
            if (!node) {
                return NULL;
            }
            if (copies.find(node) == copies.end()) {
                copies[node] = new Node(node -> val, {});
                for (Node* neighbor : node -> neighbors) {
                    copies[node] -> neighbors.push_back(cloneGraph(neighbor));
                }
            }
            return copies[node];
        }
    private:
        unordered_map<Node*, Node*> copies;
    };
    


### Solution 3
Use HashMap to look up nodes and add connection to them while performing BFS.

    
    
    public class Solution {
        public UndirectedGraphNode cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode node) {
            if (node == null) return null;
            
            UndirectedGraphNode newNode = new UndirectedGraphNode(node.label); //new node for return
            HashMap<Integer, UndirectedGraphNode> map = new HashMap(); //store visited nodes
            
            map.put(newNode.label, newNode); //add first node to HashMap
            
            LinkedList<UndirectedGraphNode> queue = new LinkedList(); //to store **original** nodes need to be visited
            queue.add(node); //add first **original** node to queue
            
            while (!queue.isEmpty()) { //if more nodes need to be visited
                UndirectedGraphNode n = queue.pop(); //search first node in the queue
                for (UndirectedGraphNode neighbor : n.neighbors) {
                    if (!map.containsKey(neighbor.label)) { //add to map and queue if this node hasn't been searched before
                        map.put(neighbor.label, new UndirectedGraphNode(neighbor.label));
                        queue.add(neighbor);
                    }
                    map.get(n.label).neighbors.add(map.get(neighbor.label)); //add neighbor to new created nodes
                }
            }
            
            return newNode;
        }
    }
