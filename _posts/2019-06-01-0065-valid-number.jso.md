title: 65. Valid Number
---
### Question
Validate if a given string can be interpreted as a decimal number.

Some examples:  
`"0"` => `true`  
`" 0.1 "` => `true`  
`"abc"` => `false`  
`"1 a"` => `false`  
`"2e10"` => `true`  
`" -90e3   "` => `true`  
`" 1e"` => `false`  
`"e3"` => `false`  
`" 6e-1"` => `true`  
`" 99e2.5 "` => `false`  
`"53.5e93"` => `true`  
`" --6 "` => `false`  
`"-+3"` => `false`  
`"95a54e53"` => `false`

**Note:** It is intended for the problem statement to be ambiguous. You should
gather all requirements up front before implementing one. However, here is a
list of characters that can be in a valid decimal number:

  * Numbers 0-9
  * Exponent - "e"
  * Positive/negative sign - "+"/"-"
  * Decimal point - "."

Of course, the context of these characters also matters in the input.

**Update (2015-02-10):**  
The signature of the `C++` function had been updated. If you still see your
function signature accepts a `const char *` argument, please click the reload

### Solution 1
The description do not give a clear explantion of the definition of a valid
Number, we just use more and more trick to get the right solution. It's too
bad, it's waste of my time


### Solution 2
All we need is to have a couple of flags so we can process the string in
linear time:

    
    
    public boolean isNumber(String s) {
        s = s.trim();
        
        boolean pointSeen = false;
        boolean eSeen = false;
        boolean numberSeen = false;
        boolean numberAfterE = true;
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            if('0' <= s.charAt(i) && s.charAt(i) <= '9') {
                numberSeen = true;
                numberAfterE = true;
            } else if(s.charAt(i) == '.') {
                if(eSeen || pointSeen) {
                    return false;
                }
                pointSeen = true;
            } else if(s.charAt(i) == 'e') {
                if(eSeen || !numberSeen) {
                    return false;
                }
                numberAfterE = false;
                eSeen = true;
            } else if(s.charAt(i) == '-' || s.charAt(i) == '+') {
                if(i != 0 && s.charAt(i-1) != 'e') {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return numberSeen && numberAfterE;
    }
    

We start with trimming.

  * If we see `[0-9]` we reset the number flags.
  * We can only see `.` if we didn't see `e` or `.`.
  * We can only see `e` if we didn't see `e` but we did see a number. We reset numberAfterE flag.
  * We can only see `+` and `-` in the beginning and after an `e`
  * any other character break the validation.

At the and it is only valid if there was at least 1 number and if we did see
an `e` then a number after it as well.

So basically the number should match this regular expression:

`[-+]?(([0-9]+(.[0-9]*)?)|.[0-9]+)(e[-+]?[0-9]+)?`


### Solution 3
I was asked in the interview of linkedIn, writing it directly can be extremely
complicated, for there are many special cases we have to deal with, and the
code I wrote was messy. Then I failed to pass the interview.

Here's a clear solution. With DFA we can easily get our idea into shape and
then debug, and the source code is clear and simple.

    
    
    class Solution(object):
      def isNumber(self, s):
          """
          :type s: str
          :rtype: bool
          """
          #define a DFA
          state = [{}, 
                  {'blank': 1, 'sign': 2, 'digit':3, '.':4}, 
                  {'digit':3, '.':4},
                  {'digit':3, '.':5, 'e':6, 'blank':9},
                  {'digit':5},
                  {'digit':5, 'e':6, 'blank':9},
                  {'sign':7, 'digit':8},
                  {'digit':8},
                  {'digit':8, 'blank':9},
                  {'blank':9}]
          currentState = 1
          for c in s:
              if c >= '0' and c <= '9':
                  c = 'digit'
              if c == ' ':
                  c = 'blank'
              if c in ['+', '-']:
                  c = 'sign'
              if c not in state[currentState].keys():
                  return False
              currentState = state[currentState][c]
          if currentState not in [3,5,8,9]:
              return False
          return True
