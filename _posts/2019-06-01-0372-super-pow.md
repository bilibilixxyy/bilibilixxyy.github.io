### Question
Your task is to calculate _a_ _b_ mod 1337 where _a_ is a positive integer and
_b_ is an extremely large positive integer given in the form of an array.

 **Example 1:**

    
    
     **Input:** a = 2, b = [3]
    **Output:** 8
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** a = 2, b = [1,0]
    **Output:** 1024
    

### Solution 1
One knowledge: ab % k = (a%k)(b%k)%k  
Since the power here is an array, we'd better handle it digit by digit.  
One observation:  
a^1234567 % k = (a^1234560 % k) * (a^7 % k) % k = (a^123456 % k)^10 % k * (a^7
% k) % k  
Looks complicated? Let me put it other way:  
Suppose f(a, b) calculates a^b % k; Then translate above formula to using f :  
f(a,1234567) = f(a, 1234560) * f(a, 7) % k = f(f(a, 123456),10) * f(a,7)%k;  
Implementation of this idea:

    
    
    class Solution {
        const int base = 1337;
        int powmod(int a, int k) //a^k mod 1337 where 0 <= k <= 10
        {
            a %= base;
            int result = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
                result = (result * a) % base;
            return result;
        }
    public:
        int superPow(int a, vector<int>& b) {
            if (b.empty()) return 1;
            int last_digit = b.back();
            b.pop_back();
            return powmod(superPow(a, b), 10) * powmod(a, last_digit) % base;
        }
    };
    

**Note:** This approach is definitely not the fastest, but it is something one
can quickly understand and write out when asked in an interview.  
And this approach is not using any built-in "pow" functions, I think this is
also what the interviewer would expect you to do.  
Hope it helps!


### Solution 2
1337 only has two divisors 7 and 191 exclusive 1 and itself, so judge if `a`
has a divisor of 7 or 191, and note that 7 and 191 are prime numbers, `phi` of
them is itself - 1, then we can use the Euler's theorem, see it on wiki
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_theorem),
it's just [Fermat's little
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem) if the mod
`n` is prime.

see how 1140 is calculated out:  
phi(1337) = phi(7) * phi(191) = 6 * 190 = 1140

##  **optimized solution update at 2016-7-12**

Today, seeing @myanonymos 's comments, and I find several days ago I AC it
just by fortunate coincidence, it's not the best solution. now I get a better
idea.

(1) Firstly, if `a` has both divisor 7 and 191, that's `a % 1337 == 0`, answer
is 0.  
(2) Then if `a` has neither divisor 7 nor 191, that's a and 1337 are coprime,
so **a b % 1337 = ab % phi(1337)  % 1337 = ab % 1140  % 1337**.

(3) Finally, `a` could has either divisor 7 or 191, that's similar.  
Let it be 7 for example.  
Let **a = 7 nx**  
and let **b = 1140p + q** , where **0 < q <= 1140**  
then:

 **a b % 1337**  
 **= ((7 nx)b) % 1337**  
 **= (7 nbxb) % 1337**  
 **= ( (7 nb % 1337) * (xb % 1337) ) % 1337**  
 **= ( (7 1140np + nq % 1337) * (x1140p + q % 1337) ) % 1337**

now note x and 1337 are coprime, so

 **= ( (7 1140np + nq % 1337) * (xq % 1337) ) % 1337**  
 **= ( 7 * (7 1140np + nq - 1 % 191) * (xq % 1337) ) % 1337**

note 7 and 191 are coprime too, and 1140 is a multiple of 190, where 190 =
phi(191). What's more we should assure that q != 0, if b % 1140== 0, then let
b = 1140. so

 **= ( 7 * (7 nq - 1 % 191) * (xq % 1337) ) % 1337**  
 **= ( (7 nq % 1337) * (xq % 1337) ) % 1337**  
 **= (7 nqxq) % 1337**  
 **= ((7 nx)q) % 1337**  
 **= (a q) % 1337**

now you see condition (2) and (3) can be merged as one solution, if you take
care of when `b % 1440 == 0`, and let `b += 1140`. Actually (1) can be merged
too, but not efficient.

new code:  
C++:

    
    
    int superPow(int a, vector<int>& b) {
        if (a % 1337 == 0) return 0; // this line could also be removed
        int p = 0;
        for (int i : b) p = (p * 10 + i) % 1140;
        if (p == 0) p += 1140;
        return power(a, p, 1337);
    }
    int power(int x, int n, int mod) {
        int ret = 1;
        for (x %= mod; n; x = x * x % mod, n >>= 1) if (n & 1) ret = ret * x % mod;
        return ret;
    }
    

java:

    
    
    public int superPow(int a, int[] b) {
        if (a % 1337 == 0) return 0;
        int p = 0;
        for (int i : b) p = (p * 10 + i) % 1140;
        if (p == 0) p += 1440;
        return power(a, p, 1337);
    }
    public int power(int a, int n, int mod) {
        a %= mod;
        int ret = 1;
        while (n != 0) {
            if ((n & 1) != 0) ret = ret * a % mod;
            a = a * a % mod;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return ret;
    }
    

Actually, if p == 0 or not, we can always let p += 1140, it doesn't matter.  
one line python:

    
    
    def superPow(self, a, b):
        return 0 if a % 1337 == 0 else pow(a, reduce(lambda x, y: (x * 10 + y) % 1140, b) + 1140, 1337)
    

**will this be the best solution?**

p.s.  
I have testcases that the system missed  
574  
[1,1,4,0]

764  
[1,1,4,0]  
in this case if I remove this line of code `if (p == 0) p += 1140;`, it will
get wrong answer, but also can get AC on OJ.

and I found thar 574 * 574 % 1337 = 574, 764 * 764 % 1337 = 764, how
interesting!


### Solution 3
Just to test whether the candidate knows
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation>?

Which company has asked this question? Curious.
