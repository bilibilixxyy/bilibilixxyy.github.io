title: 322. Coin Change
---
### Question
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money
_amount_. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need
to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any
combination of the coins, return `-1`.

 **Example 1:**

    
    
     **Input:** coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
    **Output:**3 
    **Explanation:** 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** coins = [2], amount = 3
    **Output:** -1
    

**Note** :  
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

### Solution 1
    
    
    class Solution {
    public:
        int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
            int Max = amount + 1;
            vector<int> dp(amount + 1, Max);
            dp[0] = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < coins.size(); j++) {
                    if (coins[j] <= i) {
                        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coins[j]] + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
            return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
        }
    };


### Solution 2
#Recursive Method:#  
The idea is very classic dynamic programming: think of the last step we take.
Suppose we have already found out the best way to sum up to amount `a`, then
for the last step, we can choose any coin type which gives us a remainder `r`
where `r = a-coins[i]` for all `i`'s. For every remainder, go through exactly
the same process as before until either the remainder is 0 or less than 0
(meaning not a valid solution). With this idea, the only remaining detail is
to store the minimum number of coins needed to sum up to `r` so that we don't
need to recompute it over and over again.

Code in Java:

    
    
    public class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        if(amount<1) return 0;
        return helper(coins, amount, new int[amount]);
    }
    
    private int helper(int[] coins, int rem, int[] count) { // rem: remaining coins after the last step; count[rem]: minimum number of coins to sum up to rem
        if(rem<0) return -1; // not valid
        if(rem==0) return 0; // completed
        if(count[rem-1] != 0) return count[rem-1]; // already computed, so reuse
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int coin : coins) {
            int res = helper(coins, rem-coin, count);
            if(res>=0 && res < min)
                min = 1+res;
        }
        count[rem-1] = (min==Integer.MAX_VALUE) ? -1 : min;
        return count[rem-1];
    }
    }
    

#Iterative Method:#  
For the iterative solution, we think in bottom-up manner. Suppose we have
already computed all the minimum counts up to `sum`, what would be the minimum
count for `sum+1`?

Code in Java:

    
    
    public class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        if(amount<1) return 0;
        int[] dp = new int[amount+1];
        int sum = 0;
        
    	while(++sum<=amount) {
    		int min = -1;
        	for(int coin : coins) {
        		if(sum >= coin && dp[sum-coin]!=-1) {
        			int temp = dp[sum-coin]+1;
        			min = min<0 ? temp : (temp < min ? temp : min);
        		}
        	}
        	dp[sum] = min;
    	}
    	return dp[amount];
    }
    }

### Solution 3
Assume `dp[i]` is the fewest number of coins making up amount `i`, then for
every `coin` in `coins`, dp[i] = min(dp[i - coin] + 1).

The time complexity is `O(amount * coins.length)` and the space complexity is
`O(amount)`

    
    
    class Solution(object):
        def coinChange(self, coins, amount):
            MAX = float('inf')
            dp = [0] + [MAX] * amount
    
            for i in xrange(1, amount + 1):
                dp[i] = min([dp[i - c] if i - c >= 0 else MAX for c in coins]) + 1
    
            return [dp[amount], -1][dp[amount] == MAX]
