title: 289. Game of Life

### Question
According to the [Wikipedia's
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The **Game
of Life** , also known simply as **Life** , is a cellular automaton devised by
the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a _board_ with _m_ by _n_ cells, each cell has an initial state _live_
(1) or _dead_ (0). Each cell interacts with its [eight
neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal,
vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above
Wikipedia article):

  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board
given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules
simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths
occur simultaneously.

 **Example:**

    
    
     **Input:** [
      [0,1,0],
      [0,0,1],
      [1,1,1],
      [0,0,0]
    ]
    **Output:** [
      [0,0,0],
      [1,0,1],
      [0,1,1],
      [0,1,0]
    ]
    

**Follow up** :

  1. Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
  2. In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

### Solution 1
To solve it in place, we use 2 bits to store 2 states:

    
    
    [2nd bit, 1st bit] = [next state, current state]
    
    - 00  dead (next) <- dead (current)
    - 01  dead (next) <- live (current)  
    - 10  live (next) <- dead (current)  
    - 11  live (next) <- live (current) 
    

  * In the beginning, every cell is either `00` or `01`.
  * Notice that `1st` state is independent of `2nd` state.
  * Imagine all cells are instantly changing from the `1st` to the `2nd` state, at the same time.
  * Let's count # of neighbors from `1st` state and set `2nd` state bit.
  * Since every `2nd` state is by default dead, no need to consider transition `01 -> 00`.
  * In the end, delete every cell's `1st` state by doing `>> 1`.

For each cell's `1st` bit, check the 8 pixels around itself, and set the
cell's `2nd` bit.

  * Transition `01 -> 11`: when `board == 1` and `lives >= 2 && lives <= 3`.
  * Transition `00 -> 10`: when `board == 0` and `lives == 3`.

To get the current state, simply do

    
    
    board[i][j] & 1
    

To get the next state, simply do

    
    
    board[i][j] >> 1
    

Hope this helps!

    
    
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        if (board == null || board.length == 0) return;
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
    
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int lives = liveNeighbors(board, m, n, i, j);
    
                // In the beginning, every 2nd bit is 0;
                // So we only need to care about when will the 2nd bit become 1.
                if (board[i][j] == 1 && lives >= 2 && lives <= 3) {  
                    board[i][j] = 3; // Make the 2nd bit 1: 01 ---> 11
                }
                if (board[i][j] == 0 && lives == 3) {
                    board[i][j] = 2; // Make the 2nd bit 1: 00 ---> 10
                }
            }
        }
    
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                board[i][j] >>= 1;  // Get the 2nd state.
            }
        }
    }
    
    public int liveNeighbors(int[][] board, int m, int n, int i, int j) {
        int lives = 0;
        for (int x = Math.max(i - 1, 0); x <= Math.min(i + 1, m - 1); x++) {
            for (int y = Math.max(j - 1, 0); y <= Math.min(j + 1, n - 1); y++) {
                lives += board[x][y] & 1;
            }
        }
        lives -= board[i][j] & 1;
        return lives;
    }


### Solution 2
Since the board has ints but only the 1-bit is used, I use the 2-bit to store
the new state. At the end, replace the old state with the new state by
shifting all values one bit to the right.

    
    
    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        int m = board.size(), n = m ? board[0].size() : 0;
        for (int i=0; i<m; ++i) {
            for (int j=0; j<n; ++j) {
                int count = 0;
                for (int I=max(i-1, 0); I<min(i+2, m); ++I)
                    for (int J=max(j-1, 0); J<min(j+2, n); ++J)
                        count += board[I][J] & 1;
                if (count == 3 || count - board[i][j] == 3)
                    board[i][j] |= 2;
            }
        }
        for (int i=0; i<m; ++i)
            for (int j=0; j<n; ++j)
                board[i][j] >>= 1;
    }
    

Note that the above `count` counts the live ones among a cell's neighbors and
the cell itself. Starting with `int count = -board[i][j]` counts only the live
neighbors and allows the neat

    
    
    if ((count | board[i][j]) == 3)
    

test. Thanks to aileenbai for showing that one in the comments.


### Solution 3
For the second follow-up question, here's a solution for an infinite board.
Instead of a two-dimensional array of ones and zeros, I represent the board as
a set of live cell coordinates.

    
    
    def gameOfLifeInfinite(self, live):
        ctr = collections.Counter((I, J)
                                  for i, j in live
                                  for I in range(i-1, i+2)
                                  for J in range(j-1, j+2)
                                  if I != i or J != j)
        return {ij
                for ij in ctr
                if ctr[ij] == 3 or ctr[ij] == 2 and ij in live}
    

And here's a wrapper that uses the above infinite board solution to solve the
problem we have here at the OJ (submitted together, this gets accepted):

    
    
    def gameOfLife(self, board):
        live = {(i, j) for i, row in enumerate(board) for j, live in enumerate(row) if live}
        live = self.gameOfLifeInfinite(live)
        for i, row in enumerate(board):
            for j in range(len(row)):
                row[j] = int((i, j) in live)
