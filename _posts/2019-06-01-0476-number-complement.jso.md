title: 476. Number Complement
---
### Question
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement
strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 **Note:**  

  1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
  2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

 **Example 1:**  

    
    
     **Input:** 5
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
    

**Example 2:**  

    
    
    **Input:** 1
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
    

### Solution 1
    
    
    // OJ: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/
    // Author: github.com/lzl124631x
    // Time: O(1) as there are at most 32 bits to move
    // Space: O(1)
    class Solution {
    public:
        int findComplement(int num) {
            unsigned mask = ~0;
            while (num & mask) mask <<= 1;
            return ~mask & ~num;
        }
    };
    

For example,

    
    
    num          = 00000101
    mask         = 11111000
    ~mask & ~num = 00000010

### Solution 2
I post solution first and then give out explanation. Please think why does it
work before read my explanation.

    
    
    public class Solution {
        public int findComplement(int num) {
            return ~num & ((Integer.highestOneBit(num) << 1) - 1);
        }
    }
    

According to the problem, the result is

  1. The `flipped` version of the original `input` but
  2. Only flip `N` bits within the range from `LEFTMOST` bit of `1` to `RIGHTMOST`.  
For example input = `5` (the binary representation is `101`), the `LEFTMOST`
bit of `1` is the third one from `RIGHTMOST` (`100`, `N` = 3). Then we need to
flip 3 bits from `RIGHTMOST` and the answer is `010`

To achieve above algorithm, we need to do 3 steps:

  1. Create a bit mask which has `N` bits of `1` from `RIGHTMOST`. In above example, the mask is `111`. And we can use the decent Java built-in function `Integer.highestOneBit` to get the `LEFTMOST` bit of `1`, left shift one, and then minus one. Please remember this wonderful trick to create bit masks with `N` ones at `RIGHTMOST`, you will be able to use it later.
  2. Negate the whole input number.
  3. `Bit AND` numbers in step `1` and `2`.

Three line solution if you think one line solution is too confusing:

    
    
    public class Solution {
        public int findComplement(int num) {
            int mask = (Integer.highestOneBit(num) << 1) - 1;
            num = ~num;
            return num & mask;
        }
    }
    

`UPDATE`  
As several people pointed out, we don't need to left shift 1. That's true
because the highest `1` bit will always become `0` in the `Complement` result.
So we don't need to take care of that bit.

    
    
    public class Solution {
        public int findComplement(int num) {
            return ~num & (Integer.highestOneBit(num) - 1);
        }
    }
    


### Solution 3
for example:  
100110, its complement is 011001, the sum is 111111. So we only need get the
min number large or equal to num, then do substraction

    
    
        public int findComplement(int num) 
        {
            int i = 0;
            int j = 0;
            
            while (i < num)
            {
                i += Math.pow(2, j);
                j++;
            }
            
            return i - num;
        }
