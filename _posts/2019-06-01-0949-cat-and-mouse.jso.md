title: 949. Cat and Mouse
---
### Question
A game on an **undirected** graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who
alternate turns.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[a]` is a list of all nodes `b` such that
`ab` is an edge of the graph.

Mouse starts at node 1 and goes first, Cat starts at node 2 and goes second,
and there is a Hole at node 0.

During each player's turn, they **must** travel along one  edge of the graph
that meets where they are.  For example, if the Mouse is at node `1`, it
**must** travel to any node in `graph[1]`.

Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)

Then, the game can end in 3 ways:

  * If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.
  * If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.
  * If ever a position is repeated (ie. the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.

Given a `graph`, and assuming both players play optimally, return `1` if the
game is won by Mouse, `2` if the game is won by Cat, and `0` if the game is a
draw.



 **Example 1:**

    
    
     **Input:** [[2,5],[3],[0,4,5],[1,4,5],[2,3],[0,2,3]]
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:**
     4---3---1
    |   |
    2---5
     \ /
      0
    



 **Note:**

  1. `3 <= graph.length <= 50`
  2. It is guaranteed that `graph[1]` is non-empty.
  3. It is guaranteed that `graph[2]` contains a non-zero element. 

### Solution 1
If I see this problem during an interview, it should imply that the
interviewer doesn't want to hire me for some reason. So I'd better say goodbye
and gently close the door...


### Solution 2
Updated on 02/02/2019.  
Thanks for @sguaaa pointting out bug. If there are two cycles on both end, the
code failed on:
[[6],[4,11],[9,12],[5],[1,5,11],[3,4,6],[0,5,10],[8,9,10],[7],[2,7,12],[6,7],[1,4],[2,9]].  
I guess the problem is I preallocate `dp[mouse][cat] = 0` at the beginning of
each iteration, which may not right.

I feel exhausted after spending hours on investigating this problem but still
no conclution. Anyone has idea on how to fix the code?  
Thank you for discussion!

    
    
    class Solution {
        public int catMouseGame(int[][] graph) {
            int size = graph.length;
            int dp[][] = new int[size][size];
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
                Arrays.fill(dp[i], -1);  // unvisited
    
            for (int i = 1; i < size; ++i) {
                dp[0][i] = 1;   // mouse reached home, m win
                dp[i][i] = 2;   // cat met mouse, cat win
            }
    
            return helper(graph, 1, 2, dp);
        }
    
        public int helper(int[][] graph, int mouse, int cat, int dp[][]) {
    
            if (dp[mouse][cat] != -1)
                return dp[mouse][cat];  // use cached value
    
            dp[mouse][cat] = 0;  // if there is a cycle, draw
            int mouseDefault = 2;  //  default cat win, try to update this number to 1 or 0
            int[] mouseGoList = graph[mouse], catGoList = graph[cat];
    
            for (int mouseGo : mouseGoList) {
                if (mouseGo == cat)
                    continue;   // I'm a mouse, why go for a cat?
    
                int catDefault = 1;  //  default mouse win, try to update this number to 2 or 0
                for (int catGo : catGoList) {
                    if (catGo == 0)
                        continue;  // cannot go to hole
                    int next = helper(graph, mouseGo, catGo, dp);
                    if (next == 2) {   // if cat win in this path, no need to continue
                        catDefault = 2;
                        break;
                    }
                    if (next == 0) {   // at least it's a draw
                        catDefault = 0;
                    }
                }
    
                if (catDefault == 1) {  // if mouse can win in this path, no need to continue
                    mouseDefault = 1;
                    break;
                }
                if (catDefault == 0) {  // at least it's a draw
                    mouseDefault = 0;
                }
            }
            dp[mouse][cat] = mouseDefault;
            return dp[mouse][cat];
        }
    }
    


### Solution 3
Basically the DFS with memo solutions generate status nodes like `(cat, mouse,
turn)`. Before DFS to next level, we mark current node to `0` which means
`Draw`. However, there might be **cycles** in the `status graph`.

i.e, We mark current node to `Draw`. Then we go into the cycle and mark all
nodes in the cycle to `Draw`. However, the right answer to current node could
be `Cat` or `Mouse`, this can only be figured out in the later DFS. But the
nodes in the cycle have already been marked to `Draw` mistakenly.

Check this case:  
[[6],[4],[9],[5],[1,5],[3,4,6],[0,5,10],[8,9,10],[7],[2,7],[6,7]]  
![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/wangzi6147/image_1538335324.png)

We will first get a `Draw` in node `(7, 5, mouse)` then later we use this
information to mark `(9, 5, cat)` to `Draw`. However `(9, 5, cat)` should be
`Mouse`.

I believe the right solution should be using Topological traversal and
coloring like the post in [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/cat-and-
mouse/solution/) to solve the cycle problem. Also I noticed that many people
used DP to solve this problem correctly but I don't understand those
solutions. Can anyone help?

This test case was generated manually. Correct me if I'm wrong.

The idea of Topological traversal is start from each ending status,
topologically traversal to color the previous status.

Similar to the solution, my code for reference:

    
    
    class Solution {
        public int catMouseGame(int[][] graph) {
            int n = graph.length;
            // (cat, mouse, mouseMove = 0)
            int[][][] color = new int[n][n][2];
            int[][][] outdegree = new int[n][n][2];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // cat
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { // mouse
                    outdegree[i][j][0] = graph[j].length;
                    outdegree[i][j][1] = graph[i].length;
                    for (int k : graph[i]) {
                        if (k == 0) {
                            outdegree[i][j][1]--;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
            for (int k = 1; k < n; k++) {
                for (int m = 0; m < 2; m++) {
                    color[k][0][m] = 1;
                    q.offer(new int[]{k, 0, m, 1});
                    color[k][k][m] = 2;
                    q.offer(new int[]{k, k, m, 2});
                }
            }
            while (!q.isEmpty()) {
                int[] cur = q.poll();
                int cat = cur[0], mouse = cur[1], mouseMove = cur[2], c = cur[3];
                if (cat == 2 && mouse == 1 && mouseMove == 0) {
                    return c;
                }
                int prevMouseMove = 1 - mouseMove;
                for (int prev : graph[prevMouseMove == 1 ? cat : mouse]) {
                    int prevCat = prevMouseMove == 1 ? prev : cat;
                    int prevMouse = prevMouseMove == 1 ? mouse : prev;
                    if (prevCat == 0) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    if (color[prevCat][prevMouse][prevMouseMove] > 0) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    if (prevMouseMove == 1 && c == 2 || prevMouseMove == 0 && c == 1
                        || --outdegree[prevCat][prevMouse][prevMouseMove] == 0) {
                        color[prevCat][prevMouse][prevMouseMove] = c;
                        q.offer(new int[]{prevCat, prevMouse, prevMouseMove, c});
                    }
                }
            }
            return color[2][1][0];
        }
    }
