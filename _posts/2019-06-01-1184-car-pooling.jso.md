### Question
You are driving a vehicle that has `capacity` empty seats initially available
for passengers.  The vehicle **only** drives east (ie. it **cannot** turn
around and drive west.)

Given a list of `trips`, `trip[i] = [num_passengers, start_location,
end_location]` contains information about the `i`-th trip: the number of
passengers that must be picked up, and the locations to pick them up and drop
them off.  The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from
your vehicle's initial location.

Return `true` if and only if it is possible to pick up and drop off all
passengers for all the given trips.



 **Example 1:**

    
    
     **Input:** trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
    **Output:** false
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
    **Output:** true
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** trips = [[2,1,5],[3,5,7]], capacity = 3
    **Output:** true
    

**Example 4:**

    
    
    **Input:** trips = [[3,2,7],[3,7,9],[8,3,9]], capacity = 11
    **Output:** true
    





 **Constraints:**

  1. `trips.length <= 1000`
  2. `trips[i].length == 3`
  3. `1 <= trips[i][0] <= 100`
  4. `0 <= trips[i][1] < trips[i][2] <= 1000`
  5. `1 <= capacity <= 100000`

### Solution 1
# Intuition

Since we only have 1,001 `stops`, we can just figure out how many people get
it and out in each location.

# Solution

Process all trips, adding passenger count to the start location, and removing
it from the end location. After processing all trips, a positive value for the
specific location tells that we are getting more passengers; negative - more
empty seats.

Finally, scan all stops and check if we ever exceed our vehicle capacity.

## C++

    
    
    bool carPooling(vector<vector<int>>& trips, int capacity) {
      int stops[1001] = {};
      for (auto t : trips) stops[t[1]] += t[0], stops[t[2]] -= t[0];
      for (auto i = 0; capacity >= 0 && i < 1001; ++i) capacity -= stops[i];
      return capacity >= 0;
    }
    

## Java

    
    
    public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {    
      int stops[] = new int[1001]; 
      for (int t[] : trips) {
          stops[t[1]] += t[0];
          stops[t[2]] -= t[0];
      }
      for (int i = 0; capacity >= 0 && i < 1001; ++i) capacity -= stops[i];
      return capacity >= 0;
    }
    

# Complexity Analysis

Runtime: _O(n)_ , where _n_ is the number of trips.  
Memory: _O(m)_ , where _m_ is the number of stops.


### Solution 2
##  **Intuition**

Same as [253\. Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-
ii/discuss/278270/Java-Sort-All-Time-Point).  
Track the change of capacity in time order.

##  **Explanation**

  1. Save all time points and the change on current `capacity`
  2. Sort all the changes on the key of time points.
  3. Track the current `capacity` and return `false` if negative

##  **Complexity**

Time `O(NlogN)`  
Space `O(N)`

  

 **Java:**

    
    
     class Solution {
        public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
            Map<Integer, Integer> m = new TreeMap<>();
            for (int[] t : trips) {
                m.put(t[1], m.getOrDefault(t[1], 0) + t[0]);
                m.put(t[2], m.getOrDefault(t[2], 0) - t[0]);
            }
            for (int v : m.values()) {
                capacity -= v;
                if (capacity < 0) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            return true;
        }
    }
    

**C++:**

    
    
         bool carPooling(vector<vector<int>>& trips, int capacity) {
            map<int, int> m;
            for (auto &t : trips)
                m[t[1]] += t[0], m[t[2]] -= t[0];
            for (auto &v : m)
                if ((capacity -= v.second) < 0)
                    return false;
            return true;
        }
    

**Python:**

    
    
        def carPooling(self, trips, capacity):
             for i, v in sorted(x for n, i, j in trips for x in [[i, n], [j, - n]]):
                capacity -= v
                if capacity < 0:
                    return False
            return True
    


### Solution 3
  1. Sort the `trips` array by start location;
  2. Use a PriorityQueue to store the `trips`, order by ending location.
  3. Loop through the `trips` array, for each start location, keep polling out the arrays with correpoinding end location <= current start location, for each polled out array, add the corresponding passengers to `capacity`; deduct passengers at current start location from `capacity`, if `capacity < 0`, return `false`.
  4. Repeat 3 till end, if never encounter `false`, return `true`.

    
    
        public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
            Arrays.sort(trips, Comparator.comparing(trip -> trip[1]));
            PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparing(trip -> trip[2]));
            for (int[] trip : trips) {
                while (!pq.isEmpty() && trip[1] >= pq.peek()[2]) // any passengers need to get off?
                    capacity += pq.poll()[0]; // more capacity as passengers out.
                capacity -= trip[0]; // less capacity as passengers in.
                if (capacity < 0) return false; // not enough capacity.
                pq.offer(trip); // put into PriorityQueue the infomation at current location.
            }
            return true;
        }
    

**Analysis:**

Time: O(nlogn), space: O(n), n = trips.length.
