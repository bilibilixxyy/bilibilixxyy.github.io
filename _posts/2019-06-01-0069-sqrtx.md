title: 69. Sqrt(x)
---
### Question
Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of _x_ , where  _x_  is guaranteed to be a
non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only
the integer part of the result is returned.

 **Example 1:**

    
    
     **Input:** 4
    **Output:** 2
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** 8
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
                  the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
    

### Solution 1
Instead of using fancy Newton's method, this plain binary search approach also
works.

    
    
    public int sqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0)
            return 0;
        int left = 1, right = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (true) {
            int mid = left + (right - left)/2;
            if (mid > x/mid) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                if (mid + 1 > x/(mid + 1))
                    return mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
    }


### Solution 2
Quite a few people used Newton already, but I didn't see someone make it this
short. Same solution in every language. Explanation under the solutions.

 **C++ and C**

    
    
        long r =  x;
        while (r*r > x)
            r = (r + x/r) / 2;
        return r;
    

**Python**

    
    
        r =  x
        while r*r > x:
            r = (r + x/r) / 2
        return r
    

**Ruby**

    
    
        r =  x
        r = (r + x/r) / 2 while r*r > x
        r
    

**Java and C#**

    
    
        long r = x ;
        while (r*r > x)
            r = (r + x/r) / 2;
        return (int) r;
    

**JavaScript**

    
    
        r =  x;
        while (r*r > x)
            r = ((r + x/r) / 2) | 0;
        return r;
    

* * *

**Explanation**

Apparently, [using only integer division for the Newton method
works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_square_root#Using_only_integer_division).
And I guessed that if I start at x, the root candidate will decrease
monotonically and never get too small.

The above solutions all got accepted, and in C++ I also verified it locally on
my PC for all possible inputs (0 to 2147483647):

    
    
    #include <iostream>
    #include <climits>
    using namespace std;
    
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        long long r = x;
        while (r*r > x)
            r = (r + x/r) / 2;
        return r;
    }
    
    int main() {
        for (long long x=0; x<=INT_MAX; ++x) {
            long long r = mySqrt(x);
            if (r<0 || r*r > x || (r+1)*(r+1) <= x)
                cout << "false: " << x << " " << r << endl;
            if (x % 10000000 == 0)
                cout << x << endl;
        }
        cout << "all checked" << endl;
    }


### Solution 3
## Basic Idea:

* * *

Since sqrt(x) is composed of binary bits, I calculate sqrt(x) by deciding
every bit from the most significant to least significant. **Since an integer n
can have O(log n) bits with each bit decided within constant time, this
algorithm has time limit O(log n), actually, because an Integer can have at
most 32 bits, I can also say this algorithm takes O(32)=O(1) time.**

      public int sqrt(int x) {
        if(x==0)
            return 0;
        int h=0;
        while((long)(1<<h)*(long)(1<<h)<=x) // firstly, find the most significant bit
            h++;
        h--;
        int b=h-1;
        int res=(1<<h);
        while(b>=0){  // find the remaining bits
            if((long)(res | (1<<b))*(long)(res |(1<<b))<=x)
                res|=(1<<b);
            b--;
        }
        return res;
    }
