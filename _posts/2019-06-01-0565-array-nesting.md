title: 565. Array Nesting
---
### Question
A zero-indexed array A of length N contains all integers from 0 to N-1. Find
and return the longest length of set S, where S[i] = {A[i], A[A[i]],
A[A[A[i]]], ... } subjected to the rule below.

Suppose the first element in S starts with the selection of element A[i] of
index = i, the next element in S should be A[A[i]], and then A[A[A[i]]]â€¦ By
that analogy, we stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in S.



 **Example 1:**

    
    
     **Input:** A = [5,4,0,3,1,6,2]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** 
    A[0] = 5, A[1] = 4, A[2] = 0, A[3] = 3, A[4] = 1, A[5] = 6, A[6] = 2.
    
    One of the longest S[K]:
    S[0] = {A[0], A[5], A[6], A[2]} = {5, 6, 2, 0}
    



 **Note:**

  1. N is an integer within the range [1, 20,000].
  2. The elements of A are all distinct.
  3. Each element of A is an integer within the range [0, N-1].

### Solution 1
The idea is to, start from every number, find `circle`s in those `index-
pointer-chains`, every time you find a set (a circle) `mark every number as
visited (-1)` so that next time you won't step on it again.  
 **C++**

    
    
     class Solution {
    public:
        int arrayNesting(vector<int>& a) {
            size_t maxsize = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
                size_t size = 0;
                for (int k = i; a[k] >= 0; size++) {
                    int ak = a[k];
                    a[k] = -1; // mark a[k] as visited;
                    k = ak;
                }
                maxsize = max(maxsize, size);
            }
    
            return maxsize;
        }
    };
    

**Java**

    
    
     public class Solution {
        public int arrayNesting(int[] a) {
            int maxsize = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
                int size = 0;
                for (int k = i; a[k] >= 0; size++) {
                    int ak = a[k];
                    a[k] = -1; // mark a[k] as visited;
                    k = ak;
                }
                maxsize = Integer.max(maxsize, size);
            }
    
            return maxsize;
        }
    }
    


### Solution 2
    
    
    	/ ** 
    	 * This is actually a DFS.  Use a visited map to keep track of visited node. If a 
    number is visited before, then the set that starts at this number must be smaller then
     previous max. So we can safely skip this number. In total it's O(n) complexity.
    	 */
    
    
    
    public int arrayNesting(int[] nums) {
            int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            boolean[] visited = new boolean[nums.length];
            for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            	if (visited[i]) 
            		continue;
            	max = Math.max(max, calcLength(nums, i, visited));
            }
            return max;
        }
    	
    	private int calcLength(int[] nums, int start, boolean[] visited) {
    		int i = start, count = 0;
    		while (count == 0 || i != start) {
    			visited[i] = true;
    			i = nums[i];
    			count++;
    		}
    		return count;
    	}
    


### Solution 3
Basically this problem means find the biggest cycle. One thing we shall notice
is once `i` has been visited in previous different cycle, it must **not** in
current cycle and we can ignore it.

    
    
     class Solution(object):
        def arrayNesting(self, nums):
            """
            :type nums: List[int]
            :rtype: int
            """
            ans, step, n = 0, 0, len(nums)
            seen = [False] * n
            for i in range(n):
                while not seen[i]:
                    seen[i] = True
                    i, step = nums[i], step + 1
                ans = max(ans, step)
                step = 0
            return ans
