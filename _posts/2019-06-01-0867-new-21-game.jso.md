title: 867. New 21 Game
---
### Question
Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with `0` points, and draws numbers while she has less than `K`
points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from
the range `[1, W]`, where `W` is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the
outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `K` or more points.  What is the
probability that she has `N` or less points?

 **Example 1:**

    
    
     **Input:** N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
    **Output:** 1.00000
    **Explanation:** Alice gets a single card, then stops.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
    **Output:** 0.60000
    **Explanation:** Alice gets a single card, then stops.
    In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
    **Output:** 0.73278

 **Note:**

  1. `0 <= K <= N <= 10000`
  2. `1 <= W <= 10000`
  3. Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within `10^-5` of the correct answer.
  4. The judging time limit has been reduced for this question.

### Solution 1
 **Intuition** :  
The same problems as "Climbing Stairs".

 **Explanation** :  
In a word,  
`dp[i]`: probability of get points `i`  
`dp[i] = sum(last W dp values) / W`

To get `Wsum = sum(last W dp values)`, we can maintain a sliding window with
size at most `W`.

 **Time Complexity** :  
O(N)

 **C++:**

    
    
         double new21Game(int N, int K, int W) {
            if (K == 0 || N >= K + W) return 1.0;
            vector<double> dp(N + 1);
            dp[0] = 1.0;
            double Wsum = 1.0, res = 0.0;
            for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
                dp[i] = Wsum / W;
                if (i < K) Wsum += dp[i]; else res += dp[i];
                if (i - W >= 0) Wsum -= dp[i - W];
            }
            return res;
        }
    

**Java:**

    
    
         public double new21Game(int N, int K, int W) {
            if (K == 0 || N >= K + W) return 1;
            double dp[] = new double[N + 1],  Wsum = 1, res = 0;
            dp[0] = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
                dp[i] = Wsum / W;
                if (i < K) Wsum += dp[i]; else res += dp[i];
                if (i - W >= 0) Wsum -= dp[i - W];
            }
            return res;
        }
    

**Python:**

    
    
        def new21Game(self, N, K, W):
             if K == 0 or N >= K + W: return 1
            dp = [1.0] + [0.0] * N
            Wsum = 1.0
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                dp[i] = Wsum / W
                if i < K: Wsum += dp[i]
                if i - W >= 0: Wsum -= dp[i - W]
            return sum(dp[K:])
    


### Solution 2
Firstly I came up with a basic DP solution which cost `O((K + W) * W)` time
and it runs TLE:

    
    
    class Solution {
        public double new21Game(int N, int K, int W) {
            if (K == 0) {
                return 1;
            }
            int max = K + W - 1;
            double[] dp = new double[max + 1];
            dp[0] = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i <= max; i++) {
                for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++) {
                    if (i - j >= 0 && i - j < K) {
                        dp[i] += dp[i - j] / W;
                    }
                }
            }
            double result = 0;
            for (int i = K; i <= N; i++) {
                result += dp[i];
            }
            return result;
        }
    }
    

Then I realize that the transition equation `dp[i] = (dp[i - W] + dp[i - W +
1] + ... + dp[i - 1]) / W` could be simplified to `dp[i] = (sum[i - 1] - sum[i
- W - 1]) / W`.

Furthermore, if we use `dp[i]` to directly represent the `sum[i]`, we can get
`dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (dp[i - 1] - dp[i - W - 1]) / W`. This equation takes us
to the final `O(K + W)` solution. Just take care with the beginning and the
end of the array.

    
    
    class Solution {
        public double new21Game(int N, int K, int W) {
            if (K == 0) {
                return 1;
            }
            int max = K + W - 1;
            double[] dp = new double[max + 1];
            dp[0] = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i <= max; i++) {
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
                if (i <= W) {
                    dp[i] += dp[i - 1] / W;
                } else {
                    dp[i] += (dp[i - 1] - dp[i - W - 1]) / W;
                }
                if (i > K) {
                    dp[i] -= (dp[i - 1] - dp[K - 1]) / W;
                }
            }
            return dp[N] - dp[K - 1];
        }
    }

Nobody wants to participate in such a contest if the quality is so low.
