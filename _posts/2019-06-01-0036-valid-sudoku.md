title: 36. Valid Sudoku
---
### Question
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be
validated  **according to the following rules** :

  1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
  2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
  3. Each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with
the character `'.'`.

 **Example 1:**

    
    
     **Input:**
    [
      ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
      ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
      [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
      ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
      ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
      ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
      [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
      [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
      [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
    ]
    **Output:** true
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:**
    [
       ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
      ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
      [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
      ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
      ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
      ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
      [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
      [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
      [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
    ]
    **Output:** false
    **Explanation:** Same as Example 1, except with the **5** in the top left corner being 
        modified to **8**. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
    

**Note:**

  * A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
  * Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
  * The given board contain only digits `1-9` and the character `'.'`.
  * The given board size is always `9x9`.

### Solution 1
Collect the set of things we see, encoded as strings. For example:

  * `'4' in row 7` is encoded as `"(4)7"`.
  * `'4' in column 7` is encoded as `"7(4)"`.
  * `'4' in the top-right block` is encoded as `"0(4)2"`.

Scream `false` if we ever fail to add something because it was already added
(i.e., seen before).

    
    
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        Set seen = new HashSet();
        for (int i=0; i<9; ++i) {
            for (int j=0; j<9; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] != '.') {
                    String b = "(" + board[i][j] + ")";
                    if (!seen.add(b + i) || !seen.add(j + b) || !seen.add(i/3 + b + j/3))
                        return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

**Edit:** Just occurred to me that we can also make it really clear and self-
explaining. I'm loving it.

    
    
     public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        Set seen = new HashSet();
        for (int i=0; i<9; ++i) {
            for (int j=0; j<9; ++j) {
                char number = board[i][j];
                if (number != '.')
                    if (!seen.add(number + " in row " + i) ||
                        !seen.add(number + " in column " + j) ||
                        !seen.add(number + " in block " + i/3 + "-" + j/3))
                        return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }


### Solution 2
    
    
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        for(int i = 0; i<9; i++){
            HashSet<Character> rows = new HashSet<Character>();
            HashSet<Character> columns = new HashSet<Character>();
            HashSet<Character> cube = new HashSet<Character>();
            for (int j = 0; j < 9;j++){
                if(board[i][j]!='.' && !rows.add(board[i][j]))
                    return false;
                if(board[j][i]!='.' && !columns.add(board[j][i]))
                    return false;
                int RowIndex = 3*(i/3);
                int ColIndex = 3*(i%3);
                if(board[RowIndex + j/3][ColIndex + j%3]!='.' && !cube.add(board[RowIndex + j/3][ColIndex + j%3]))
                    return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }


### Solution 3
Three flags are used to check whether a number appear.

used1: check each row

used2: check each column

used3: check each sub-boxes

    
    
    class Solution
    {
    public:
        bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char> > &board)
        {
            int used1[9][9] = {0}, used2[9][9] = {0}, used3[9][9] = {0};
            
            for(int i = 0; i < board.size(); ++ i)
                for(int j = 0; j < board[i].size(); ++ j)
                    if(board[i][j] != '.')
                    {
                        int num = board[i][j] - '0' - 1, k = i / 3 * 3 + j / 3;
                        if(used1[i][num] || used2[j][num] || used3[k][num])
                            return false;
                        used1[i][num] = used2[j][num] = used3[k][num] = 1;
                    }
            
            return true;
        }
    };
